# 🌄 Mementum Dashboard

**Mementum Dashboard** is a minimalist and customizable new tab dashboard designed to enhance your focus and productivity. Inspired by projects like [Momentum](https://momentumdash.com/) and [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/home) course, it displays the current time, date, and includes personal widgets such as a to-do list, cryptocurrency price and weather updates. The entire codebase was written by me from scratch, without copying from external sources.

> ⚠️ This project is a work in progress. Some features are not yet implemented, and full responsiveness is still being developed.
